# cert-manager v1.21.2 can give a recreated Certificate the deleted Certificate's private key

This draft is for botbox's maintainer to file at cert-manager. The agents that wrote it may
not search cert-manager's tracker, so the maintainer searches it before filing. No agent may
file it. The agents had no registry and only a Kubernetes 1.37.0 node image, while
cert-manager v1.21.2 tests on 1.33 to 1.36. So the maintainer also reruns the documented
command on 1.36, against the released chart with `enableCertificateOwnerRef: true`. The
issue body starts below the horizontal rule. Its links are relative to this file, so they
need botbox's URL before filing.

## Summary

botbox, a black-box test harness for Kubernetes controllers, found this in cert-manager
v1.21.2 with `--enable-certificate-owner-ref=true`.

A client deletes a Certificate with the default background cascade. Within about 10 ms it
creates one with the same name and `secretName`. The new Certificate's Secret then often
holds the deleted Certificate's private key. It gets there in one of two ways:

- **Write-back.** The garbage collector deletes the Secret. cert-manager then creates it
  again, with a new UID, from the copy still in its informer cache. Either the issuing
  controller applies the cached data with the new Certificate as owner, or, under
  `rotationPolicy: Never`, an issuance reuses the cached key.
- **Re-point.** The issuing controller's apply lands before the garbage collector's delete.
  The Secret then names a live owner, so the garbage collector keeps it.

What follows depends on the new Certificate's spec:

- If the spec is unchanged, the new Certificate becomes Ready with the old key. Under
  `rotationPolicy: Always`, the default, cert-manager issues nothing, so the policy never
  applies, and the Secret keeps the deleted Certificate's certificate too.
- If a field such as `dnsNames` changes, cert-manager issues a new certificate. Under
  `Never` it signs the old key. Under `Always` it generates a new key.
- If the spec asks for another key algorithm under `Never`, the new Certificate stays
  `Ready=False` with reason `SecretMismatch`, waiting for a user.

So a client that recreates a Certificate within about 10 ms, to get a new key, can keep the
old one. On an idle kind cluster, `kubectl replace --force` is too slow for that. A
foreground cascade (`kubectl delete --cascade=foreground`) closes the window. The old
Certificate then goes only after the garbage collector has deleted its Secret.

## Code path

Paths are relative to cert-manager v1.21.2. The issuing controller writes a Secret back like
this:

- While a Certificate is not `Issuing`, the issuing controller calls `ensureSecretData`
  (`pkg/controller/certificates/issuing/issuing_controller.go:198-206`).
- `ensureSecretData` reads the Secret from the informer's cache
  (`pkg/controller/certificates/issuing/secret_manager.go:40`).
- `SecretOwnerReferenceMismatch` finds no ownerReference with the new Certificate's UID
  (`internal/controller/certificates/policies/checks.go:756-790`). cert-manager logs
  `applying Secret data` with the message `unexpected Secret Owner Reference value on
  Secret --enable-certificate-owner-ref=true`, and calls `UpdateData` with the data it
  read (`secret_manager.go:98-99`).
- `UpdateData` server-side-applies that data with `Force: true` and one controller
  ownerReference to the new Certificate
  (`pkg/controller/certificates/issuing/internal/secret.go:108-127`). Its doc says "If the
  Secret resource does not exist, it will be created on Apply" (`internal/secret.go:92`).

Whether the new Certificate is issued depends on the trigger policy chain
(`internal/controller/certificates/policies/policies.go:71-84`):

- With an unchanged spec, the old Secret passes every check. No CertificateRequest belongs
  to the new Certificate, so `CurrentCertificateRequestMismatchesSpec` compares the Secret's
  certificate with the spec instead (`checks.go:214-223`). The readiness chain
  (`policies.go:89-102`) passes the same way, so the Certificate becomes Ready. Only
  `SecretDoesNotExist` can start an issuance, when the trigger controller runs while the
  Secret is gone.
- The key manager acts only while a Certificate is `Issuing`
  (`pkg/controller/certificates/keymanager/keymanager_controller.go:178-187`). So without
  an issuance, `rotationPolicy` never applies.
- When the spec changes, the trigger chain starts an issuance. Under `Never`, the key
  manager reads the Secret from the informer's cache (`keymanager_controller.go:250`). It
  reuses that Secret's key, or waits for a user when the key does not fit the spec
  (`:262-281`). The cache can still hold a Secret that the garbage collector has deleted.
  Issuance then creates the Secret again with the old key (`issuing_controller.go:464`).
  This is the second write-back path.

kube-controller-manager's garbage collector reads the dependent, checks each owner, and
deletes it with UID and resourceVersion preconditions. After a Conflict, it retries without
the resourceVersion only if the ownerReferences did not change. It keeps a dependent that
names a live owner. See Kubernetes v1.37.0,
`pkg/controller/garbagecollector/garbagecollector.go:521-577` and `:654`, and
`operations.go:53-80`.

## Documented behaviour

- The help for `--enable-certificate-owner-ref`
  (`cmd/controller/app/options/options.go:181-183`) says: "When this flag is enabled, the
  secret will be automatically removed when the certificate resource is deleted."
- The doc of `rotationPolicy` (`pkg/apis/certmanager/v1/types_certificate.go:353-356`) says:
  "If set to `Never`, a private key will only be generated if one does not already exist in
  the target `spec.secretName`."

Under the default background cascade, the garbage collector does delete the Secret. The
write-back then creates it again from cert-manager's cache, which breaks the flag's promise.
The comment where `ensureSecretData` finds no Secret (`secret_manager.go:42-43`) states the
intent: "Secret doesn't exist so we can't do anything." The stale cache never reaches that
branch, because the lister still returns the deleted Secret.

The re-point may count as the race a background cascade leaves open.
`CertificateOwnsSecret` decides which Certificate owns a Secret by the
`cert-manager.io/certificate-name` annotation, not by ownerReferences
(`internal/controller/certificates/certificates.go:32-46`). Still, the Secret outlives the
Certificate it was issued for.

## Reproduction

[`cert-manager-secret-write-back/main.go`](cert-manager-secret-write-back/main.go) needs a
cluster with cert-manager's CRDs and cert-manager running with
`--enable-certificate-owner-ref=true`. Each run makes a namespace and a self-signed Issuer.
Then:

1. It creates Certificate `example` with `secretName: example-tls`, DNS name
   `example.test`, the default RSA key and the `-policy` given, and waits for Ready.
2. It records the Secret's UID and the sha256 of its `tls.key` and `tls.crt`.
3. It deletes the Certificate with the `-propagation` given, `Background` by default, and
   polls every 10 ms until the Certificate is gone.
4. It waits for `-pause`, none by default. Then it creates `example` again with the
   `-algorithm`, `-policy` and `-dns` given. Its clients have no rate limit, so the create
   follows within milliseconds.
5. It waits up to 30 s for the new Certificate to stay Ready, with no issuance in flight,
   for 2 s. It waits up to 30 s more for the Secret. Then it reads the Secret's UID,
   controller owner and hashes.

A run keeps the key when the Secret still holds the old one. A new UID means a write-back,
and the old UID owned by the new Certificate means a re-point. The UID does not tell which
write-back path ran. cert-manager's log and Events do. Without `-collect`, the program
never writes the Secret. From a botbox checkout:

```sh
go run ./docs/findings/cert-manager-secret-write-back -kubeconfig "$KUBECONFIG" -runs 10 -algorithm RSA -policy Always
```

The cluster was kind v0.33.0 with node v1.37.0, newer than the Kubernetes 1.33 to 1.36 that
cert-manager v1.21.2 tests on. cert-manager was v1.21.2 built from source. In all rows but
the last, it ran out of cluster with `--leader-elect=false`. In the last, it ran in the
cluster as a Deployment, with leader election and cluster-admin RBAC. Each batch of 10 runs
had one cert-manager process and one reproducer process, and the batches of every row took
turns.

| flags beside `-runs 10` | runs | key kept | write-back | re-point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-policy Always -algorithm RSA` | 30 | 15 | 14 | 1 |
| `-policy Never -algorithm RSA` | 30 | 26 | 25 | 1 |
| `-policy Never -algorithm ECDSA` | 30 | 14 | 9 | 5 |
| `-policy Never -algorithm RSA -dns other.test` | 80 | 42 | 37 | 5 |
| `-policy Always -algorithm RSA -dns other.test` | 30 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `-policy Always -algorithm RSA -propagation Foreground` | 30 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `-policy Always -algorithm RSA`, cert-manager in cluster | 30 | 9 | 8 | 1 |

- With the same spec under `Always`, every kept key came with the deleted Certificate's
  `tls.crt`, byte for byte, and `Ready=True`. Under `Never`, 17 of 26 did. The other 9 got
  a new `tls.crt` for the old key, after the key manager emitted `Reused`.
- With another DNS name under `Never`, every kept key came with a new `tls.crt` and
  `Ready=True`.
- With ECDSA under `Never`, every kept key ended `Ready=False` with reason
  `SecretMismatch`, and still `Issuing`.
- Under the foreground cascade, cert-manager never logged `applying Secret data`.
- No run ended with the old Secret uncollected.

On this idle cluster the window is short. With `-policy Always -algorithm RSA`, a pause
before the create kept the key in fewer runs:

| `-pause` | runs | key kept |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none | 50 | 29 |
| `5ms` | 20 | 2 |
| `10ms` | 20 | 1 |
| `20ms`, `50ms`, `100ms` or `200ms` | 20 each | 0 |

The 50 runs without a pause are the first row's 30 and 20 that took turns with the pauses.

`kubectl replace --force` (kubectl v1.37.0) deletes the Certificate, sees it gone, and
creates it 35 to 55 ms after the delete. With the first row's Certificate, it kept the key
in none of 20 tries.

## How botbox found it

botbox ran cert-manager against envtest, which has no garbage collector. botbox's own
collector deletes dependents with UID and resourceVersion preconditions, within 1 s of the
owner's deletion. Hunt seed 1043 recreates a `Never` Certificate with ECDSA and other
`dnsNames` and `duration`. It kept the key in 5 of 17 replays: 4 by write-back and 1 by
re-point. [`sequence.json`](cert-manager-secret-write-back/sequence.json), the recreate in
the table's ECDSA row, kept it in 3 of 8 botbox runs, all by write-back.

On a cluster without a garbage collector, the program's `-collect` deletes what the old
Certificate controls, much as kube-controller-manager would, but without its retry after a
Conflict. On envtest with `-policy Always -algorithm RSA`, it kept the key in 3 of 10 runs.

## Possible fix

`ensureSecretData` can hand `UpdateData` the UID of the Secret it read at
`secret_manager.go:40`, and `UpdateData` can put that UID in the apply. An apply that names
a UID and finds no object fails with Conflict: "uid mismatch: the provided object specified
uid %s, and no existing object was found" (k8s.io/apiserver v0.37.0,
`pkg/endpoints/handlers/patch.go:612-618`). The controller's retry then reads that the
Secret is gone. Issuance (`issuing_controller.go:464`) passes no UID, so it still creates a
missing Secret.

Against kube-apiserver 1.37.0, a forced apply of a Secret behaved like this:

- With the live Secret's UID, it updated the Secret.
- With the UID of a deleted Secret, it failed with that Conflict and created nothing.
- With the UID of a Secret that another of the same name had replaced, it failed with
  `metadata.uid: field is immutable`.

The patch closes only the issuing controller's write-back. A build of v1.21.2 with it took
turns with the stock batches above, on the table's first five rows:

| flags beside `-runs 10` | runs | key kept | write-back | re-point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-policy Always -algorithm RSA` | 30 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `-policy Never -algorithm RSA` | 30 | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| `-policy Never -algorithm ECDSA` | 30 | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| `-policy Never -algorithm RSA -dns other.test` | 80 | 9 | 3 | 6 |
| `-policy Always -algorithm RSA -dns other.test` | 30 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

- With the same spec under `Always`, it logged the Conflict above in 19 of 30 runs, and
  then generated a new key.
- With another DNS name under `Never`, it still wrote back in 3 of 80 runs. In each, the
  apply failed with the Conflict. The key manager then emitted `Reused` for the deleted
  Secret's key, and issuance created the Secret again with it.

Two paths stay open:

- The key manager still reads the Secret from its cache (`keymanager_controller.go:250`). It
  could read the Secret from the API server before it reuses a key under `Never`.
- The issuing controller still re-points a Secret that the garbage collector has yet to
  delete. cert-manager could leave a Secret alone while its controller ownerReference names
  another UID, so that the garbage collector deletes it.

No run tested either change.

## Unknown

- cert-manager may mean to adopt a Secret whose owner was deleted.
- Every run used an idle cluster. A garbage collector that lags would widen the re-point
  window. A Secret informer in cert-manager that lags, as with many Secrets, would widen the
  write-back window. No run measured either.
- No run used the released image, or a Kubernetes version that v1.21.2 tests on (1.33 to
  1.36).
- Only the tests of `pkg/controller/certificates/issuing/...` ran against the patch, and
  they pass.
