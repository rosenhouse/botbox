# Spike: a model of a dependency's controller under envtest

Date: 2026-10-07. An adopter's controller creates child CRs of another project's kind and
waits for that project's controller to mark them Ready. Under envtest nothing moves them,
so [G4](../checks.md#g4-convergence) fails. The adoption skill sends an adopter to kind
for a kind that runs Pods, and names no third-party kind. The adopter asked whether a
model of the other controller, drawn from its CRD and docs, could stand in for it, and be
told to misbehave.

## Questions

1. Is there prior art?
2. Does a model change the approach of `DESIGN.md`?
3. Where does a model plug in?

## Prior art

Six papers bound the problem.

- [Welder](https://xudongs.com/pub/sosp26_welder.pdf) (SOSP '26) states the contract this
  needs: a controller is verified against a rely condition and a depend condition, where
  the depend condition is the lower controller's eventual stability, "inspired by
  rely-guarantee reasoning". It verifies Rust controllers. No testing tool instantiates it.
- [Anvil](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi24-sun-xudong.pdf) (OSDI '24) hand-models
  the garbage collector, the StatefulSet controller and the DaemonSet controller, and
  needs a fairness assumption: a peer that keeps changing the object "can adversarially
  keep letting the target controller lose the race". A verifier assumes that away. A
  tester can inject it.
- [Kivi](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc24-liu-bingzhe.pdf) (ATC '24)
  model-checks hand-written controller models, "most controllers are modeled based on the
  Kubernetes source code", and states the limit: "If a cluster includes unmodeled
  features, our model may not provide accurate results."
- [Sieve](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi22-sun.pdf) (OSDI '22) and
  [Acto](https://cs.cornell.edu/~legunsen/pubs/GuETAlActoSOSP23.pdf) (SOSP '23) run kind
  with every built-in controller, and model nothing. Acto's future work is "to test
  interdependent operators together".
- [Oat](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi26-gu.pdf) (NSDI '26) proposes "management
  interfaces as mocks": a state machine with "a collection of bad states", kept honest by
  property-based comparison of the model and the real component.
- An [ISSTA '24 study](https://gaoyu-cn.github.io/paper/2024-issta-operatorbugs.pdf) counts
  4% of operator bugs as involving built-in controllers, and its example is this shape: an
  operator decommissions a Pod the StatefulSet controller did not pick, and leaks the
  Pod's claim.

Nothing derives a model from a CRD. Practice has the mechanism without the derivation.

- [KWOK Stages](https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/stages-configuration/) model a
  resource's lifecycle declaratively, for any resource since
  [v0.5.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kwok/releases/tag/v0.5.0): a selector of
  CEL expressions, a delay with jitter, a weight for random branching, and steps that patch
  a subresource, emit an event, add or remove a finalizer, delete the object, or apply a
  child object from a template. The shipped
  [PVC stage](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kwok/blob/main/kustomize/stage/volume/fast/pvc-provision.yaml)
  is a fake provisioner for a built-in kind, and the chaos stages take their delay, weight
  and failure reason from annotations on the object.
- [`kwokctl create cluster --runtime binary`](https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io/docs/generated/kwokctl_create_cluster/)
  runs etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler and kwok as host
  processes, downloading the Kubernetes binaries from `dl.k8s.io`, which
  [works only on Linux](https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/kwokctl-platform-specific-binaries/),
  or taking paths to installed ones. D57 rejected a controller manager beside envtest:
  `setup-envtest` ships none, and no Pod runs without a kubelet. kwokctl runs both as host
  processes, and [its docs](https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io/docs/examples/scale-with-custom-resource/)
  show a Deployment at `3/3` seconds after two fake nodes join. Not tried here.
- [Crossplane provider-nop](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-nop) is the
  model of the knobs: `conditionAfter` lists timed condition transitions, and
  `deleteAfter` and `deleteError` model slow and stuck deletion. It fakes only its own kind.
- Test suites write dependency status by hand: the kubebuilder
  [CronJob tutorial](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/writing-tests) sets a
  Job's status, and openstack-k8s-operators'
  [lib-common](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/lib-common/blob/main/modules/common/test/helpers/deployment.go)
  ships `SimulateDeploymentReplicaReady` and `SimulateJobSuccess`.
- Three catalogues say what Ready means: [KEP-1623](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/1623-standardize-conditions/README.md)
  conditions, [kstatus](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md)
  for built-ins and conventional CRDs, and Argo CD's
  [`resource_customizations`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/tree/master/resource_customizations),
  294 health scripts for 123 groups, each with real status fixtures. These give a model
  its happy path.
- A request to run kube-controller-manager under envtest was
  [closed unanswered](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/issues/3083).

## Setup

| Component | Version | How obtained |
|---|---|---|
| KWOK stage controller | v0.8.0 | `sigs.k8s.io/kwok/pkg/kwok/controllers` as a Go library |
| envtest control plane | Kubernetes 1.37.0 | `setup-envtest use 1.37.0 -p path` |
| Go | 1.26.0 | this repository's toolchain |

The driver program is `kwok-stage-envtest/main.go` next to this file. It installs a `Bar`
CRD with a status subresource and starts one stage controller over the `bars` of one
namespace with two stages. The first marks a Bar Ready for its generation 200 ms after
the Bar lags. The second marks it Ready False while an annotation says `degraded`. The
program creates a Bar, changes its spec, adds the annotation, removes it, reads the
resourceVersion twice 10 s apart, and deletes the Bar. The first stage:

```yaml
spec:
  resourceRef: {apiGroup: example.com/v1, kind: Bar}
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
    - cel: {expression: '!has(self.metadata.deletionTimestamp)'}
    - cel: {expression: '!has(self.metadata.annotations) || !("spike.example.com/mode" in self.metadata.annotations)'}
    - cel: {expression: '!has(self.status) || !has(self.status.conditions) || !self.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == "Ready" && c.status == "True" && c.observedGeneration == self.metadata.generation)'}
  delay: {durationMilliseconds: 200}
  steps:
  - patch:
      subresource: status
      root: status
      type: merge
      template: |
        observedGeneration: {{ .metadata.generation }}
        conditions:
        - {type: Ready, status: "True", observedGeneration: {{ .metadata.generation }}, reason: Modelled}
```

## Results

Four runs agreed within 35 ms.

| Observation | Value |
|---|---|
| Ready True for generation 1 after the create | 211 ms to 243 ms |
| Ready True for generation 2 after a spec change | 213 ms to 219 ms |
| Ready False for generation 2 after the `degraded` annotation | 213 ms to 216 ms |
| Ready True for generation 2 after the annotation's removal | 210 ms to 215 ms |
| resourceVersion changes between two reads 10 s apart | 0 |
| Bar gone after its delete | within 2 ms; the stages add no finalizer |

The spike ran one deviation, a degraded mode switched by an annotation on the Bar. A
target would see that annotation, and one that applies the Bar server-side may strip
it, so a harness switches a deviation inside the model. The spike ran no timed or random
deviation, and bounded none, as a fault's `until` does.

The API server refuses a strategic merge patch on a custom resource, so a CRD model
patches with `merge`, which needs no schema, and the spike passes none. kwok pins
`k8s.io/*` 0.36.1 and builds against the root module's 0.37.0 pins. The six kwok
packages the spike imports bring no controller-runtime, and do bring kustomize, the
Prometheus client, OpenTelemetry, cel-go and sprig. kwok draws a stage's weight and its
jitter from the global `math/rand` with no seed, and a `Now` template stamps the clock.
A replay would not repeat them, a shrink could not keep a candidate that fails the same
check, and [G5](../checks.md#g5-restart-stable) would blame the difference on the target.

## What it means for the design

The thesis of §1 holds. The target stays unmodified and is observed only through the API
server. A model is another writer on the API server, as the garbage-collector emulation
of D5 is. Three points move.

- §2 says reconciler-fuzzer is not a mocking framework. A model mocks another controller at the
  API server, not the target's client. The non-goal needs that sentence.
- D57 moves in two ways. kwokctl supplies the controller manager and the fake kubelet
  that D57 found missing, for the workload kinds. A stage model covers a kind no cluster
  runs a controller for.
- Attribution (§6) holds under four conditions. The dependency's kind is under `manages`,
  with its CRD under `crds`, so the Observer watches it and its objects stay the target's
  for G3, G5 and G7. The model writes with reconciler-fuzzer's own client and a UserAgent of
  its own, as the collector does, never through the proxy, so its requests are not the
  target's for G1, G2 and G6, no fault reaches them, and the settle wait does not take
  them for the target's return. The model is deterministic under the sequence's seed, so
  a replay and G5 see the same writes. The model creates no object, or labels what it
  creates and the target's `selector` leaves that label out, so `deleteManaged` never
  picks a model's child and G7 never asks the target for it back. Under these, G2
  counts only writes the proxy saw, so a model's writes are not churn, and a settle wait
  counts them as changes, so a model must go quiet once it converges, as the spike's does.

The cost is in deviations. A model told to flap, or to stay NotReady, breaks G4 for a
correct target unless the window it reaches into is unjudged and the target is owed
recovery time after it, as §6 "Recovery from faults" gives a fault. A deviation can reuse
a fault's `until` triggers. Its window and its pending writes are the model's own to
report, as `internal/proxy` reports a fault's window and the requests it holds, because
a deviation never passes the proxy. Without that, a `slow` write lands in a judged quiet
window and the target's reaction fails G1 or G2.

A model that holds a finalizer must clear it within `timeouts.delete`, or G3 fails the
target and the teardown forces the finalizer off and notes it. The model therefore runs
until the teardown has emptied the namespace, as the collector does.

The checking half exists today. A property binds `managed`, so a target can already
declare that a Ready CR owns only Ready children, guarding each field with `has()`.

A dependency plugs in here:

| Concern | Where | Pattern to copy |
|---|---|---|
| Declaration | `internal/target`, `docs/reference.md` | `fixtures`, `manages`, `ready` |
| Identity | `collectorConfig` in `internal/cluster/collector.go` | the collector's UserAgent |
| Running the model | `internal/run/run.go` starts the collector per run | `internal/cluster/collector.go` |
| Its log | `writeRecordings` in `internal/run/run.go`, the recordings list in `internal/report/markdown.go` and `docs/failures.md` | `collector.jsonl` |
| Deviation ops | `internal/run/sequence.go`, the `apply` switch in `internal/run/runner.go`, `internal/generate/faults.go`, the golden draws of D54 and the reference sequence of §7 | the `fault` op |
| Excusing a deviation | fault windows in `internal/run/runner.go` and `internal/invariant/window.go`, read beside a window and a held write the model reports | `Window` and `Held` in `internal/proxy` |
| Shrinking | `weaken` in `internal/run/shrink.go` halves a fault's `until` | the `fault` op |
| The envtest warning | `envtestLimit` in `cmd/reconciler-fuzzer/cli.go` | D57 |
| Contract checks | `properties` today, a generic check later | P1 of both examples |
| The skill | step 2 of `skills/adopt-reconciler-fuzzer/SKILL.md`, or a second skill | `.claude/skills/add-invariant/SKILL.md` |

The declaration might read:

```yaml
manages:
  - example.com/v1/Bar             # a dependency is a managed, namespaced kind under crds
dependencies:
  - kind: example.com/v1/Bar
    condition: Ready               # the KEP-1623 condition the model writes, with observedGeneration
    after: 200ms
    finalizer: example.com/bar     # optional: the model holds a deletion this long, inside timeouts.delete
```

A `ready` predicate cannot be inverted into a write, so a kind whose Ready is not a
KEP-1623 condition, or whose fields the target reads, such as an address, takes a
template, as a stage has. Deviations are generic, so the harness ships them and
generation draws them as it draws faults: `stuck`, `slow`, `flap`, `stale` (Ready for an
old generation) and `degraded` (Ready False with a reason), each bounded by an `until`.

What a model does not give:

- A status-only model of a Deployment creates no ReplicaSet, Pod or Event, and fills no
  Pod address. A target that reads those needs kwokctl or kind, and `envtestLimit` still
  says so.
- A status patch on a CRD without the subresource, or one that a status validation rule
  refuses, is retried with backoff for as long as the run lasts, and the symptom is a bare
  G4. The model should refuse such a kind when the target loads.
- A cluster-scoped or cross-namespace dependency is outside what a run observes
  ([#38](https://github.com/rosenhouse/reconciler-fuzzer/issues/38)).

## Open questions

1. Embed kwok's stage controller, or write a smaller one? Embedding works and costs no
   controller-runtime import, and the kustomize, Prometheus and OpenTelemetry packages
   above. Its weight, jitter and `Now` are unseeded, so an embedded model forbids them, or
   a smaller model draws from the sequence's seed. Its templates and CEL selectors are
   more than the sketch needs, and its versions lag the root module's by one minor.
2. A kwokctl cluster should pass `--kubeconfig` as kind does. The run waits only for the
   namespace defaults of kinds the target watches, kwokctl's controller manager runs the
   controllers that add them, and nothing in the session is kind-specific. Not tried. The
   cluster has no Node until one is added, which a cluster-scoped Node fixture carrying
   kwok's annotation can do.
3. How is a model kept honest? Oat's answer is to run the same sequences against the real
   controller on kind, and compare. A nightly tier could do that.
